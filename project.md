# project

staging post for project direction. (think quick dirty proj wiki -just a file!)

roadmap:

afto:

tidy up repo's git. √
make a poly repo just for recording.-fewer repos, no files top level,- just copy a couple.√
playground for screencasts (gh different dummy repos so can push/pull) \***\*
video scripts! ..... \*\***
install
usage

Alpha.
Tune up readme good enough to share:
st - image.
install vid.
usage vid.
draft-edit-redraft-reedit-start-from-scratch!
add template for contrib guide, etc.

Mike.
DRY code.
libs/helper - for st actions.(currently repeated)

Lima.

Quebec. 90
use GH in demo -
cloning shorttasks,
starting up demo repos.
remove them when done :)

Unicorn. 30
on install pre-check if aliases already taken.

Sierra. 60
wizzard - configure aliases.
eg Java, Ruby, Python, Go may well want different short cuts.

Papa Smurf.
Generate documentation from the cmd line help.
so dry.

Zulu. 120
lack of auto completion at cmd line for anything other than files/folder names really bugs me.
when i type
cmd space tab, it should drop down list the options.

Victor2. 30
bonus:
requires source .shell? - if so prompt if changed.

X. 120
brew package it.
consider moving from bash scripts to go.

Wisky. 120
Think restricting l is a good feature. But very restrictive.
could add white list / black list.
ie. anything -rf / F disallwed. any potentially destructive / recursives.

November.
Find good example repo of bash scripting.
https://github.com/search?l=Shell&q=a&type=Repositories
https://github.com/protocool/ack-tmbundle/blob/master/Support/ack-standalone.sh
#!/usr/bin/env perl

- have a look at env node / others, understand langs usable.

---done::::

Oscar. 5 √ normal behaviour.
demo script - actions to tty null.
eg: touch dummy files for git tasks.

vscode record - fucking great!+giphy - winner!
st - more prompt(too much for screen record (and users!)) [*]

Yankee. 30 @see Qebeck
h: gh - why? for now its just so can use it with l. eg. l h.
most powerful for seeing gh activity across all repos. pull requests, issues, activity.
