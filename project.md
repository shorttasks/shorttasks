# project

staging post for project direction. (think quick dirty proj wiki -just a file!)

roadmap:

Alpha. Tune up readme good enough to share:

3.  st - image. it looks awesome. (saves on making md table, live document)
    needs an alt.

4.  usage vid. \\\*

5.  wording: go succint, clear, factual, cool-calm-collected.

draft-edit-redraft-reedit-start-from-scratch!
add template for contrib guide, etc.

## FINISH LINE.

Hotel.
the switch side of India is vscode workspaces.
say i work on teams a,b,c, each with a few repos.
I need to be able to swithc between them - fast. and back fast.
And keep leveraging shorttasks l. would be nice eh?
so if peers package holds this information, i can generate am
active.vsocde worspace file in pk/ and filter l operations with it -
as well as switching ide on the fly! all fucking easily:
y peer switch:a && code active.vsworkspace.

India.
Finding l so useful wondering if shouldnt just apply it to all actions!
i suppose not doing it now means users can warp it them selves,
videos would need redoing - but quite easy.
suppose should test drive it. if work ok in current dir / specifying a path/
glob of paths - would go from great to fucking amazing!!!

Juliette.
if no package.json - bubble up (maybe)
.git - should notify if a dir a git operation is run is out of source control!

Kilo.
cool - type in demo - adds pesonality. more likely read than readme.md!
bonus - make demos accessible. - alt tag the text typed in. /could i provide
the demo script to be run accessibly?

Mike.
DRY code.
libs/helper - for st actions.(currently repeated)

Quebec. 90
use GH in demo -
cloning shorttasks,
starting up demo repos.
remove them when done :)

Unicorn. 30
on install pre-check if aliases already taken.

Sierra. 60
wizzard - configure aliases.
eg Java, Ruby, Python, Go may well want different short cuts.

Papa Smurf.
Generate documentation from the cmd line help.
so dry.

Zulu. 120
lack of auto completion at cmd line for anything other than files/folder names really bugs me.
when i type
cmd space tab, it should drop down list the options. see if warp terminal addressing this.

Victor2. 30
bonus:
requires source .shell? - if so prompt if changed.

Wisky. 120
Think restricting l is a good feature. But very restrictive.
could add white list / black list.
ie. anything -rf / F disallwed. any potentially destructive / recursives.

November.
Find good example repo of bash scripting.
https://github.com/search?l=Shell&q=a&type=Repositories
https://github.com/protocool/ack-tmbundle/blob/master/Support/ack-standalone.sh
#!/usr/bin/env perl

- have a look at env node / others, understand langs usable.

---done::::

Oscar. 5 √ normal behaviour.
demo script - actions to tty null.
eg: touch dummy files for git tasks.

vscode record - fucking great!+giphy - winner!
st - more prompt(too much for screen record (and users!)) [*]

Yankee. 30 @see Qebeck
h: gh - why? for now its just so can use it with l. eg. l h.
most powerful for seeing gh activity across all repos. pull requests, issues, activity.

tidy up repo's git. √
make a poly repo just for recording.-fewer repos, no files top level,- just copy a couple.√
playground for screencasts (gh different dummy repos so can push/pull)
humanised typing!!! - record typing speed per letter. apply style! quick react app :)

video scripts! ..... \*\*\*\*
install
usage

afto:
fookinell - this screen recording shite is ace!
also- great way of putting self in users shoes.
I fixed a couple of things very quickly as i built the usage demo.
so nice! the typing - acts as a mental test spec,
the fakery runs it. blown my own mind here!
serves as training tool too, can make interactive.

call it a day.
fix these for install and str:
mkdir: /Users/henry/.shorttasks: File exists
mkdir: /Users/henry/.shorttasks/lib: File exists
cp: ./shorttasks/lib is a directory (not copied).

--parking lot::::

X. 120
brew package it.
consider moving from bash scripts to go.

install vid.parked.
